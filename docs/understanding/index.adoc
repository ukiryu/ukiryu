= Understanding

Deep dive into Ukiryu's architecture, design decisions, and internal mechanisms.

// Overview
== Overview

Understanding Ukiryu requires knowing these core concepts:

* link:/understanding/register[Register] - YAML-based tool definition storage
* link:/understanding/platforms[Platforms] - Cross-platform support and detection
* link:/understanding/shells[Shells] - Shell-specific command formatting

// Core Components

=== Register

The Register is the source of truth for tool definitions. It stores YAML profiles
that describe tools, their commands, options, and platform-specific behavior.
